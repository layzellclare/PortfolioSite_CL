        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <h3>Facts</h3>
        <p>Modern weather forecast apps often display huge amounts of data and much of
          the time this is extraneous to the needs of the user. Therefore, it is not uncommon for
          users to switch from a general weather app for every day use to a more detailed one for
          water sports.</p>
        <p>Water Sports weather apps generally contain overly technical data which is poorly
          displayed, making them difficult to read for novices and on small devices.</p>
        <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
        <p>Weather forecasting apps and websites are in abundance. Most are used for general weather forecasting,
          but for those in need of more detailed information, there are a plethora of water sport specific sites at hand.
          That said, most are specific to 1 sport and often require membership in order to access the most useful information.</p>
        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>Design an app that combines the simplicity and ease of use employed in general
          weather apps with some of the detail seen in more technical water sports apps.</p>

        <h2>The Design Process</h2>
        <p>I started the process with a heuristic analysis, delving in to understand what the pain
          points are for those using weather forecasting apps for general and water sports
          purposes. Having taken up sailing in the last few years, I feel their pain! I’m a novice, so
          often feel overwhelmed by the technical data and jargon that overloads many apps and
          websites.</p>

        <h3>User Interviews</h3>
        <p>
          After conducting qualitative, quantiative and evaluative testing in the form of user surveys, interviews and A/B testing, key data and facts became quickly apparent. Key summaries and main points of interest were as follows:

            <p>75% of interviewees find the display of weather data unclear on most apps and therefore more difficult to read on a mobile;</p>
            <p>73% of interviewees would prefer to use one weather forecasting app for general and water sport specific weather information.</p>

          <h3>User Personas</h3>
          <p>
            Developping the user personas was an all together easy process. At this early stage, I had already learned that water sports enthusiasts shared many commonalities when it comes to their lifestyle and chosen water sport,
            whatever it may be.

              <p>All personas rely heavily on weather forecasting for planning in advance and as a means to ensure safety on the water;</p>

            Considering the fact I want this app to appeal to a wide age range, to varied proficiency levels, to be used easily on a mobile phone and to be easily distinguishable from competitor apps, I decided on the
            following:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Design simple iconography</li>
            <li>Limit the amount of data on any one screen</li>
            <li>Incorporate a more natural looking colour palette</li>

              Information requests (profile set up) placed on one scrollable page were replaced by a series of screens. The resulting screens are far easier to read and giver the user the opportunity to skip the request's if

              Incorporating a dark background for hours after sunset helps emphasise the time and in addition to the removal of all ‘Best for’ suggestions, is a nod to compromised safety in the water.

          <h2>Key Takeaway</h2>
          <p>From the offset, I wanted this app to be relevant to the widest possible spectrum of users, which in all truth may deem it generic to the more accomplished in their chosen water sport. However, I believe the app is
            successful in providing general weather as well as water sports weather data and ultimately removes the need to use more than one app for both purposes.</p>
          <h2>What Next?</h2>
          <p>
            Given time, I would like to concentrate my efforts on adding an alerts/notifications feature. This area was mentioned by interviewees during the early stages of the project, but unfortunately never became a reality. I would
            also relish the opportunity to incorporate 3d features, which I believe would elevate the app enormously. This could be achieved by animating the main weather icon/s and/or the water sport icons.</p>
